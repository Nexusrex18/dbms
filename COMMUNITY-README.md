# SafeNest Community Feature Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes and improvements made to the SafeNest community posting functionality.

## Issues Fixed
1. Added proper error handling for API failures
2. Implemented fallback to sample data when backend is unavailable
3. Added backend status component to help users troubleshoot connection issues
4. Created helper script to manage backend services

## Key Components

### Backend Helper Script
- Location: `backend-helper.sh`
- Purpose: Command-line tool to start, stop, and check the Flask backend service
- Usage: 
  ```bash
  # Check if backend is running
  ./backend-helper.sh check
  
  # Start the backend
  ./backend-helper.sh start
  
  # Stop the backend
  ./backend-helper.sh stop
  
  # Test API endpoints
  ./backend-helper.sh test
  ```

### Backend Status Component
- Location: `components/backend-status.tsx`
- Purpose: UI component that shows the connection status to the backend server
- Features: 
  - Live status indicator
  - Help instructions for starting the backend
  - Reconnect button

### Community Helpers
- Location: `lib/community-helpers.ts`
- Purpose: Utility functions for handling community features
- Key functions:
  - `isAPIAvailable()`: Checks if the backend API is accessible
  - `formatPost()`: Standardizes post format from various API responses
  - `formatResource()`: Standardizes resource format

### Sample Data
- Location: `lib/sample-data.ts`
- Purpose: Provides fallback data when backend is unavailable
- Contains:
  - Sample posts
  - Sample resources

## API Improvements
- Added client-side checks for API availability
- Implemented graceful fallbacks to sample data
- Improved error handling and messaging
- Added offline mode for creating posts and comments

## Usage Instructions

1. Start the backend if needed:
   ```bash
   ./backend-helper.sh start
   ```

2. Run the NextJS development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to the Community page and use the BackendStatus component to verify connection

4. Even if the backend is unavailable, the community page will still function with sample data

## Troubleshooting

If posts or comments are not being created properly:

1. Check the backend status using the status component
2. Verify that you're logged in (authentication token required for posts/comments)
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages
4. Run `./backend-helper.sh test` to verify API endpoints
5. Look at `flask.log` in the Flask app directory if backend fails to start
